# Notes
* Vehicles in this mod have higher running costs than trains in the base game. The reason is that costs in the base game are just unrealistic.
* I recommend getting a road mod for these vehicles. You can use in-game rails, but that would be unrealistic.
* As this mod is licensed under GPLv3, you are free to create your own mods based on this one. However, it must be also released under GPLv3!

I hope you'll enjoy playing with this mod!
